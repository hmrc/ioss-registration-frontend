This is the repository for Import One Stop Shop Registration Frontend

Backend: https://github.com/hmrc/ioss-registration

Stub: https://github.com/hmrc/ioss-registration-stub

Import One Stop Shop Registration Service
------------

The main function of this service is to allow traders to register to pay VAT on imports of low value goods to consumers
in the EU, Northern Ireland or both. This will then provide them with an IOSS enrolment that will allow access to other
IOSS services - Returns (ioss-returns-frontend) and Exclusions (ioss-exclusions-frontend).

Once a trader has been registered, there are a few other functions that are available in the service:

Amend - this allows the trader to amend details they used on their original registration to keep
their information up to date.

Rejoin - Once a trader has left the Import One Stop Shop service, if they would like to rejoin, they can access this
option and all of their previous registration data will be offered to reuse and edit on the rejoin.

Summary of APIs
------------

This service utilises various APIs from other platforms in order to obtain and store information required for the
registration process.

ETMP:
- HMRC VAT registration details are retrieved
- Submitted registration details are passed to ETMP for storing and later querying against

Core:
- EU VAT registrations are verified with Core to check for any exclusions

Note: locally (and on staging) these connections are stubbed via ioss-registration-stub.

Requirements
------------

This service is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), so needs at least a [JRE] to run.


## Run the application locally via Service Manager

```
sm2 --start IMPORT_ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL
```

### To run the application locally from the repository, execute the following:

The service needs to run in testOnly mode in order to access the testOnly get-passcodes endpoint which will generate a passcode for email verification.
```
sm2 --stop IOSS_REGISTRATION_FRONTEND
```
and
```
sbt run -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes
```

### Running correct version of mongo
Mongo 6 with a replica set is required to run the service. Please refer to the MDTP Handbook for instructions on how to run this

- No
2. Does your business sell goods imported from countries outside the EU and Northern Ireland to consumers in the EU 
or Northern Ireland?
- Yes
3. Do any of these goods have a consignment value of Â£135 or less?
- Yes
4. Is your business registered for VAT in the UK?
- Yes
5. Is your business in Northern Ireland?
- Yes

Continue through the journey, completing each question through to the final check-your-answers page and submit the
registration.

Email verification:
Use the test-only endpoint (http://localhost:10190/pay-vat-on-goods-sold-to-eu/register-for-import-one-stop-shop/test-only/get-passcodes)
in a separate tab to generate a passcode that can be entered into the email verification page, following adding
an email to the /business-contact-details page
